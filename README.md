<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aashman Rastogi (Aashman08)</h1> 
<h3 align="center">I'm a junior majoring in Statistics and Data Science at UCLA</h3> 

I am deeply passionate about the fascinating world of data science, where I continuously explore the immense potential hidden within vast amounts of information. The ability to uncover valuable insights and patterns from data captivates me, driving my enthusiasm to contribute meaningfully in this field. I find it exhilarating to employ data analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques to extract knowledge and make informed decisions.

Moreover, my curiosity extends from the  captivating realms of remote sensing and space exploration to utilizing gen AI to build systems and business analytics. Remote sensing, in particular, has ignited my imagination with its unique ability to gather valuable information about Earth from a distance. 

Through my projects on GitHub, I aim to combine my passion for data science, business analytics, remote sensing, space exploration and Gen AI. Utilizing the capabilities of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques, my aim is to create substantial contributions that enhance individuals' and organizations' comprehension of their data while also fostering a deeper understanding of ourselves and our planet, Earth.
